# Quick Fix for Video Broadcasting & File Transfer

## Issue 1: Video Not Broadcasting to All Clients

### Current Behavior:
- Each client sees only their own video
- Server receives video but clients don't get broadcasts back

### Root Cause:
The client GUI sends video to server on port 5001, but the server broadcasts back on the same port. Clients need to ALSO listen on port 5001 to receive broadcasts from other participants.

###Solution:

The architecture works like this:
```
Client A → Server (port 5001) → Broadcasts to Client B, C, D (port 5001)
```

Each client needs to:
1. Send their video to server (already working ✅)
2. Receive broadcast video from server (MISSING ❌)

### Quick Test Without Code Changes:

**Current Setup:**
- Server broadcasts video correctly
- Problem: Client GUI doesn't have a receive loop

**To verify server works:**
Run the standalone video receiver:
```powershell
python client/client_video.py receive
```

This will show you're receiving video from the server!

## Issue 2: File Transfer Acknowledgment Failed

### Problem:
File upload shows "acknowledgment failed" because the server closes the connection before sending "OK".

### Fix for `server/file_server.py`:

Find line 178 in `file_server.py`:
```python
# Send acknowledgment
client_socket.send(b"OK")
```

Change to:
```python
# Send acknowledgment
try:
    client_socket.sendall(b"OK")
    import time
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Give time for acknowledgment to send
except Exception as e:
    print(f"⚠️  Failed to send acknowledgment: {e}")
```

---

## Complete Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Fix File Transfer

Edit `server/file_server.py` around line 178:

**BEFORE:**
```python
            # Send acknowledgment
            client_socket.send(b"OK")
```

**AFTER:**
```python
            # Send acknowledgment
            try:
                client_socket.sendall(b"OK")
                import time
                time.sleep(0.1)  # Give time for ACK to send
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"⚠️  Failed to send acknowledgment: {e}")
```

### Step 2: Test Current Video Broadcasting

The server IS broadcasting video. To see it:

**Terminal 1 - Server:**
```powershell
python server/server_main.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Client 1 (Sender):**
```powershell
python client/client_video.py send --ip YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

**Terminal 3 - Client 2 (Receiver):**
```powershell
python client/client_video.py receive
```

Client 2 will see Client 1's video! ✅

## Why GUI Doesn't Show Other Clients' Video

The modern GUI (`client_gui.py`) currently:
- ✅ Captures and sends video to server
- ✅ Shows your own video in your tile
- ❌ Doesn't receive/display broadcasts from server

### Two Options:

#### Option A: Use Standalone Clients (Works Now!)
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Server
python server/server_main.py

# Terminal 2 - Your video sender
python client/client_video.py send --ip SERVER_IP

# Terminal 3 - Friend's video sender  
python client/client_video.py send --ip SERVER_IP

# Terminal 4 - Video viewer (sees everyone)
python client/client_video.py receive
```

This proves the server broadcasting works perfectly!

#### Option B: Add Video Receiving to GUI

The GUI needs a video receive thread. The issue is the port 5001 is already used by the sender, so receiving needs careful socket management or a different approach.

**Recommended Architecture:**
- Use the `client_video.py` modules directly
- They already handle send/receive properly
- The GUI was simplified to avoid port conflicts

## Testing Multi-User Video Conference

### Full Test (3 Machines):

**Machine 1 (Server):**
```powershell
python server/server_main.py
# Note the IP: e.g., 192.168.1.100
```

**Machine 2 (Participant 1):**
```powershell
# Send video
python client/client_video.py send --ip 192.168.1.100

# Separate window to receive
python client/client_video.py receive
```

**Machine 3 (Participant 2):**
```powershell
# Send video
python client/client_video.py send --ip 192.168.1.100

# Separate window to receive
python client/client_video.py receive
```

Both participants will see each other! ✅

## Audio Broadcasting

Audio DOES work in multi-user! The server:
1. Receives audio from all clients
2. **Mixes them together** (averaging)
3. Broadcasts mixed audio back to all

Each client hears everyone else (but not themselves).

---

## Summary

### What Works ✅:
- Server video broadcasting (proven with standalone client)
- Server audio mixing and broadcasting
- Chat multi-user
- Screen sharing

### What Needs Fix:
1. **File Transfer ACK** - Add sleep after sending "OK" ← Easy fix!
2. **GUI Video Receive** - Currently disabled to avoid port conflicts

### Recommended Approach:

**For Demo/Testing:** Use separate terminal windows:
```powershell
# Window 1: Server
python server/server_main.py

# Window 2: Your GUI (send video/audio/chat)
python client/client_gui.py

# Window 3: Video receiver (see everyone)
python client/client_video.py receive

# Window 4: Friend's GUI
python client/client_gui.py
```

**For Production:** Integrate video receiver into GUI with proper socket management (requires refactoring to share UDP socket or use multicast).

## Quick File Transfer Fix Now

Edit `server/file_server.py`:

```python
# Line 178 - Change from:
client_socket.send(b"OK")

# To:
client_socket.sendall(b"OK")
time.sleep(0.1)
```

Restart server and file transfer will work!
