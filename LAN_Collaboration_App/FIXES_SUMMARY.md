# LAN Collaboration App - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User List Broadcasting (FIXED ✓)
**Problem:** Server was tracking connected users but not broadcasting the list to clients.

**Solution:**
- Added `USER_LIST` protocol message type (0x0C) in `shared/protocol.py`
- Implemented `_broadcast_user_list()` in `server/chat_server.py`
- User list is now broadcasted when:
  - A new user joins (username extracted from first message)
  - A user leaves the chat
- Added JSON encoding/decoding for user list transmission

### 2. Client GUI Not Receiving User List (FIXED ✓)
**Problem:** Client GUI had no mechanism to receive and display connected users.

**Solution:**
- Updated `client/client_chat.py` to handle `USER_LIST` messages
- Added user list callback mechanism in ChatClient class
- Added methods:
  - `set_user_list_callback()` - Register callback for updates
  - `get_user_list()` - Get current user list
  - `on_user_list_update()` - Handle incoming user list

### 3. Video Tiles Not Showing Other Users (FIXED ✓)
**Problem:** GUI only showed self video tile, no tiles for other participants.

**Solution:**
- Added `user_tiles` dictionary to track VideoTile widgets per user
- Implemented `update_user_tiles()` method that:
  - Creates new VideoTile for each connected user
  - Removes tiles when users disconnect
  - Updates participant count display
- Connected user list updates to GUI via PyQt signals

### 4. Video Broadcasting Not Working (FIXED ✓)
**Problem:** Video was being sent to server but clients weren't receiving broadcasts.

**Solution:**
- Implemented proper `receive_video()` method in client GUI
- Video receiver now:
  - Creates UDP socket on random port
  - Registers with server by sending initial packet
  - Continuously receives video broadcasts from server
  - Decodes JPEG frames and stores them
- Added timeout (500ms) to prevent blocking

### 5. Video Display Not Updating for Received Streams (FIXED ✓)
**Problem:** Received video frames weren't being displayed on other users' tiles.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `update_video_frame()` method to:
  - Update self video (own camera)
  - Update all received video frames from other users
  - Display frames on corresponding user tiles
  - Handle fallback for generic 'other' frames

### 6. Chat Messages Not Appearing (FIXED ✓)
**Problem:** Received chat messages from other users weren't showing in GUI.

**Solution:**
- Added message callback mechanism in `client/client_chat.py`
- Implemented `on_chat_message_received()` in GUI
- Created `display_received_message()` to properly format and show messages
- Uses PyQt signals for thread-safe GUI updates

### 7. Auto-Connection (FIXED ✓)
**Problem:** Chat connection was manual, users needed to send message first.

**Solution:**
- Added automatic chat connection on GUI startup
- Uses QTimer.singleShot(500ms) to connect after GUI initialization
- This ensures user list is received immediately

## Code Optimizations

### Removed Unnecessary Code
1. **Duplicate video receiver logic** - Was stubbed out, now properly implemented
2. **Unused VideoStreamer/VideoReceiver classes** - GUI now uses direct socket approach
3. **Redundant frame storage** - Simplified received_frames dictionary

### Performance Improvements
1. **Socket timeouts** - Added 500ms timeout to video receiver to prevent blocking
2. **Efficient frame updates** - Only updates frames that changed
3. **Thread-safe signals** - All GUI updates go through PyQt signals

### Code Structure
1. **Better separation of concerns** - Network logic in clients, display logic in GUI
2. **Callback pattern** - Clean interface between chat client and GUI
3. **Error handling** - Added try-catch blocks for socket operations

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Server
```bash
cd C:\Onedrive_Docs\Sem5\CN\PROJECT\LAN_Collaboration_App
python server/server_main.py
```

### 2. Start First Client
```bash
python client/client_gui.py
```
- Enter username (e.g., "Alice")
- Enter server IP (127.0.0.1 for local testing)
- Turn ON camera (click camera button)
- Turn ON microphone if needed

### 3. Start Second Client (Different Machine or Same)
```bash
python client/client_gui.py
```
- Enter different username (e.g., "Bob")
- Enter same server IP
- Turn ON camera
- Check if Alice's video appears on Bob's screen

### 4. Verify Features
- ✓ User list shows all connected users
- ✓ Participant count updates (top-left)
- ✓ Video tiles appear for each user
- ✓ Video streams display in real-time
- ✓ Chat messages appear for all users
- ✓ User join/leave notifications work

## Known Limitations

1. **Video per user tracking** - Currently uses generic 'other' key for received video. To properly track which video belongs to which user, need to add user ID to video packets.

2. **Audio mixing** - Audio server implements mixing but client GUI needs similar receiver implementation as video.

3. **Screen sharing** - Server and client modules exist but not integrated into GUI buttons yet.

## Windows-Specific Notes

- Uses `cv2.CAP_DSHOW` for camera on Windows
- UDP sockets work properly on Windows
- PyQt5 signals are thread-safe on Windows
- File paths use backslashes (handled by Path objects)

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. Add username to video packets for proper per-user video display
2. Implement audio receiver similar to video receiver
3. Add screen sharing button functionality
4. Add video quality settings
5. Add connection status indicators per user
6. Implement proper error recovery and reconnection logic
