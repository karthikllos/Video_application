# Architecture of LAN Collaboration App

## Overview
The LAN Collaboration App is designed to facilitate real-time communication and collaboration among users on a local area network (LAN). The application consists of a server component that manages connections and sessions, and client components that provide user interfaces for interaction.

## System Architecture
The architecture of the application is divided into several key components:

1. **Server**
   - The server is responsible for handling incoming connections from clients, managing user sessions, and facilitating communication between clients.
   - It implements various protocols for different types of data (audio, video, chat) to ensure efficient transmission.

2. **Client**
   - The client application provides a user interface for users to interact with the server and other clients.
   - It handles user input, displays messages, and manages audio/video streams.

3. **Core**
   - The core module includes essential functionalities such as network discovery to find available servers on the LAN and synchronization of data between clients and the server.
   - Utility functions are also included to support various operations across the application.

## Data Flow
1. **Connection Establishment**
   - Clients initiate a connection to the server using predefined IP addresses and ports.
   - The server accepts connections and assigns unique session identifiers to each client.

2. **Message Handling**
   - Clients can send messages (text, audio, video) to the server, which processes these messages and forwards them to the appropriate recipients.
   - The server uses handlers to manage different types of messages and ensure they are delivered correctly.

3. **Synchronization**
   - The synchronization module ensures that all clients have the latest data and updates, maintaining consistency across the application.

4. **Network Discovery**
   - Clients can discover available servers on the LAN using broadcast messages, allowing users to connect without needing to know the server's IP address.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the application.
- **PyQt/Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **Socket Programming**: For handling network communication between clients and the server.
- **Multithreading**: To manage multiple client connections simultaneously on the server.

## Conclusion
The LAN Collaboration App is structured to provide a seamless and efficient communication experience for users on a local network. By separating concerns into distinct modules (server, client, core), the application is designed to be scalable and maintainable.
